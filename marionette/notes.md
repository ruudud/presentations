# Intro

Backbone.js is quickly becoming the most popular framework for building modular
client-side JavaScript applications. This is largely due to its low barrier to
entry; getting started with it is super-simple. 

Backbone.Marionette was created to alleviate a lot of the growing pains of
Backbone development. 

# Om Backbone Views

Backbone views are almost more convention than they are code.

Backbone provides a great set of building blocks for our JavaScript
applications. It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build
small apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that
support mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is
not a complete framework. It's a set of building blocks. It leaves
much of the application design, architecture and scalability to the 
developer, including memory management, view management, and more.


# Om Marionette

Marionette is a composite application library for Backbone.js that aims to
simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications.

It is a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in the
applications that we have been building with Backbone, and includes pieces
inspired by composite application architectures, event-driven architectures,
messaging architectures, and more.

## Layout

In this template, there are two placeholder divs that represent the menu and
the main content area of the layout.

There's a header with an image / logo, and a footer with a copyright statement
as well.

The content of the menu and the main-content divs will change, but the header,
footer and general layout will stay the same.
